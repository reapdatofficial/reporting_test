Google,Lassiwala Dhaba,Ajith M.A,"Rated 3.0 out of 5,",a month ago,"I ordered thru zomato. The taste was good but the packing was terrible. It was not sealed properly. So most of the gravies got spilled inside the carry bag, all over my floor üòê and everything got mixed up."
Google,Lassiwala Dhaba,Aisha Sithika,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",7 months ago,"Had my food delivered from this place.The food was really delicious and quantity was good too for the price offered.The packaging was neat and clean,with no spillage ensured.I had ordered veg punjabi delight thali for a price of ‚Çπ297 through zomato.It included:2 phulka1 aloo paratha1 lassiKadhi pakoda(2 pakodas)Paneer butter masala(2 paneer pieces)Dal makhniSaladMix vegYellow dal fryMatar pulao1 gulag jamun"
Google,Lassiwala Dhaba,Hari Narayanan,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",a year ago,The place is located inside from main road. The dine in ambience was very good.We ordered Veg and Paneer Biriyani.. the taste was really good. Onion Raitha was really tasty and it looked like mayonnaise.I am not sure whether dine in has started but I am including the menu card. You can surely give them a try and you will not be disappointed.
Google,Lassiwala Dhaba,ajai surviving,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",4 months ago,Food was great. No doubt about.I requested for dine in over phone call.I liked their food when I ordered on swiggy. Just wanted to try it directly. It was awesome.Actually they are not open completely  for dine in. For now Maybe they can accommodate few during their free hours as they are super busy with online orders.When they are open fully for dine in its going to be a super evening spot for ppl.Happy that we were there.
Google,Lassiwala Dhaba,Harini Nagarajan,"Rated 4.0 out of 5,",3 months ago,Have ordered many times. Never let down on quantity. Quality is good too. Especially veg thalis and a few veg gravies are good.Phulkas sometimes have a grainy texture - it will be good if the store looks into this especially the flour that is used.
Google,Lassiwala Dhaba,Mahendra Raj k,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",3 weeks ago,"I don't recommend dining in since very poor late table service as they focus on serving Zomato and swiggy orders. And for the first time in my life I had a watery bhaji(poured from a drum..not from tava) in pav bhaji and chicken gravy. Only Breads(Pulkha, Paratha) are good. Don't decide by rating!"
Google,Lassiwala Dhaba,Indiran K,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",2 months ago,"Food is good, tasty and enough quantity. Quality is good. I like their North Indian Thali. Fried rice is also good. Biryani is not traditional biriyani but sort of Fried rice version with Biryani masala, though the taste is okay. Price is normal."
Google,Lassiwala Dhaba,Vishal Haridoss,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",3 months ago,"I ordered through Swiggy. Paratha, phulka and a combo. Combo was good. But size of my Paratha and phulka was so small. It was smaller than my hand. I called the owner to complaint. He told me ""the size is standard for all. But as you have complained, i can give you two phulka extra next time"". I paid 25 rupees for the butter phulka. 25 RUPEES. When I said this, he told me that other shops will have bigger size because they charge you 50 60 rupees for you on that. FYI I have got a good size of phulka in different restaurant for 30 rupees. He did not want to do anything for this order. He insisted me not to give one star rating because as he is giving complement on my next order. Bad luck with his negotiation. I rate 1 star. YOU LOST A GOOD CUSTOMER."
Google,Lassiwala Dhaba,Raja Barani,"Rated 4.0 out of 5,",a month ago,Good thing is the place simple and taste is appreciableEven though intially they said short of man power  they couldn't  serve but aftersometime they did serve .Pricing vs content is not less or not more .  Little more content would be  better
Google,Lassiwala Dhaba,BHARATHI. S,"Rated 4.0 out of 5,",11 months ago,I had paneer tikka here.....it was so good....all those roti varieties were also good....
Google,Lassiwala Dhaba,Andrew Chris,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",a year ago,"Ordered Tandoori Half via Swiggy (150Rs I'm a super member) It was cooked to perfection. Juicy, succulent and charred to perfection. Phulka was kinda small (no sides) Chicken Murgh Biryani 10/10 No unwanted masala !!! Dine in looked decent too.Taste 10/10 (for dishes I tried) Ambience / Dine in 8/10. Hospitality 8/10."
Google,Lassiwala Dhaba,vijayendhiran parthiban,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",9 months ago,"Foods are very tasty and very friendly shop. You can pay by cash / google pay, swiping machines are not available ."
Google,Lassiwala Dhaba,Anand Kumar,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",6 months ago,Ordered via Swiggy. 45 mins for preparing just 1 mixed veg gravy that was so spicy that we couldn't eat even after adding ghee and sugar. Even the delivery person asked me not to order here as he had to wait so long with his hunger. It was my first order and it's going to be my last too.
Google,Lassiwala Dhaba,Jayachu TV,"Rated 2.0 out of 5,",3 years ago,"First thing is No one to receive us. Slowly the waiter came and took the orders. We ordered masala puri but the waiter came with bhel Puri. After sometime he came with masala puri, but it was not up to the mark, not tasty and not worth the price. Ambience was good, but there was a manhole under our table. Chicken pakoda was more like chicken 65 but not tasty. There was no water in the pot, and was placed too late. On the whole don‚Äôt judge the book by its cover, so don‚Äôt judge by seeing its ambience. They should improve a lot in their food quality and service."
Google,Lassiwala Dhaba,Aaditya Shivhare,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",4 years ago,"Tasty food better than 5 star hotels. An awesome place to have food from. Its a very small place with nothing attractive to see upon. If you haven't tasted its food before, you might just walk away on seeing the area of this place (as i almost was going to do). But the food ia juat yummy and probably healthy also. Its lassis are really tasty. It is difficult to get such quality lassis around whole chennai. Its mostly a takeaway place for food, but there are ~2 tablea kept there in case you want to dine. Overall it is the best north indian food i have had till now in Chennai. And the price, is dead cheap, like a desi dhaba price. Whatever you and your friends eat (total 4-5ppl), it is difficult to take the bill over 1000rs. Kulcha is 10rs, great lassis are 50rs. I have attached the photo of menu  with the review. After being in this place, you would be convinced that size or glamour of a place has nothing to do with quality of food. Its the chef which matters. Chef is nice and great in here. Plus he is humble and simple. Timings are from 12pm to 10pm"
Google,Lassiwala Dhaba,Zeeshan Mohammed,"Rated 2.0 out of 5,",5 months ago,"Poor experience. Butter Naan had no butter, it was half cooked. Would have been happy if food tasted well inspite of waiting 30 mins there."
Google,Lassiwala Dhaba,Veda Selvakumar (Veda),"Rated 3.0 out of 5,",3 years ago,"Surprise, it's not just lassi. But a multi cuisine restaurant.South indian items are ok. But not the north indian ones. Especially phulka is not good.Lassi is not so unique, just like any other shop, sugar filled with rose essence and traces of nuts"

Google,Lassiwala Dhaba,Harish Venkatakrishnan,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",7 months ago,Very very good food. Value for money and i must state that it was a hidden gem which somehow missed me all these days. Quantity is more than sufficient for two people and quality is exemplary.

Google,Lassiwala Dhaba,Chakravarthy S,"Rated 2.0 out of 5,",3 years ago,"Used to be good when they were small. Since they moved to a bigger facility, the quality of food has gone below average. The Indian bread items have gone pathetic. I happened to be a regular visitor and kind of staying away from this restaurant now. Bring back that taste what they used to serve a few years ago. Hopeful still."
Google,Lassiwala Dhaba,Ashwanth Ram,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",a year ago,"Small restaurant but very tasty, Veg food is very good , especially the paneer recipes are excellent, and best restaurant in Santhoshpuram, near sembakkam area which is so much tasty.Cost is little more in swiggy but if you go to the restaurant directly you can enjoy the taste of the Veg dishes and best of all is the : Phulka Roti provided there with Bhindi Sabzi .so enjoy the lassi wala dhaba!!!!!"
Google,Lassiwala Dhaba,hari venkat,"Rated 3.0 out of 5,",a year ago,Iam ordering for first time. Looks like small dhabha but the food is of good quality and taste more like any good local north indian restaurant. Kind of bit made north indian stuff. But there is some effect after sometime . Not sure if any substance like aginamoto is added?
Google,Lassiwala Dhaba,Pradeep s,"Rated 4.0 out of 5,",a year ago,"This place located inside from main road little difficult to found, ordered online veg thali sounds good so went there to taste more veraities but place not open for dine-in only take always allowed."
Google,Lassiwala Dhaba,Karthik J,"Rated 4.0 out of 5,",a year ago,"Food is really good but pls reduce plastic packaging in everything.Also swiggy and zomato shows different items. If one has an item, other doesn't and vice-versa. Pls keep items in sync in both apps."

Google,Lassiwala Dhaba,Siddharth Nagarajan,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",4 years ago,"It is a small shop mostly known for takeaway comprising of lip-smacking North Indian dishes and delicious Lassi. The menu varies everyday with each day owning its own specialty. The price tags for each item on the menu brings althemore delight to the heart of any person. I would recommend any lover of food to go try, and review and relish each dish. And to all bachelors who are reluctant to cook, this is the right place for you to have a sumptuous meal with a bill that brings smiles."
